# Bookworm (Core Data)

## Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biEoxuawaXA&t=0s">Hacking With Swift</a>

This app is based off Paul Hudson's Bookworm app that is built as part of his Hacking With Swift series. The app allows the user to save books they have read including a star rating, review, and genre. The data is stored locally on device using Core Data. This app is similar to the one built during the 100 Days of Swift UI except that it uses Core Data instead of SwiftData.
